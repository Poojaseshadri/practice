Python Practice Repository:

        --> This repository contains Python practice programs covering fundamental concepts like data types, conditions, loops, functions, file handling, and more. The project is managed using Git and pushed to GitHub.

Project Overview:

        --> This repository includes various Python scripts that help in understanding core programming concepts. 
    
    The following topics are covered:
        
        Data Types --> int, float, string, list, tuple, set, dictionary
        Type Casting --> Converting between data types
        Conditional Statements --> if, elif, else
        Loops --> for loop, while loop, continue, break
        Functions --> Regular functions and lambda functions
        Exception Handling --> try, except, finally
        File Handling --> Reading, writing, appending files
        Git & GitHub Usage --> Version control using Git and pushing changes to github.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language --> Python
    Version Control --> Git & GitHub
    IDE --> VS Code

Git Commands Used for Pushing to GitHub:

    cd E:\Python\practice          
    dir
